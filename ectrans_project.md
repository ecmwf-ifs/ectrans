ecTrans is the global spherical Harmonics transforms library, extracted from the IFS. It is using a hybrid of MPI and OpenMP parallelisation strategies. The package contains both single- and double precision Fortran libraries (trans_sp, trans_dp), as well as a C interface to the double-precision version (transi_dp)
