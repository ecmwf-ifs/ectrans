ecTrans
*******

Introduction
============

ecTrans is the global spherical Harmonics transforms library, extracted from the IFS.
It contains both CPU and GPU (Nvidia) code-paths.
The CPU version uses a hybrid of MPI and OpenMP parallelisation strategies, while the GPU version combines MPI and OpenACC.
A default installation builds both CPU libraries (trans_sp, trans_dp) and various flavours of GPU libraries in (trans_gpu_{sp/dp} shared library, trans_gpu_static_{sp/dp} static library, trans_gpu_static_CA_{sp/dp} static library requiring CUDA-aware MPI implementation), as well as a C interface to the double-precision version (transi_dp). A simple benchmark driver is also built against each of these libraries, allowing simple testing of the transforms.

Installing ecTrans
==================

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Linux
- Apple MacOS

Other UNIX-like operating systems may work too out of the box.

The GPU codepath has only been tested with NVHPC compilers on recent Nvidia GPUs.

Requirements
------------
- Fortran compiler with OpenMP support
- C compiler
- FIAT (see https://github.com/ecmwf-ifs/fiat )
- ecBuild (see https://github.com/ecmwf/ecbuild)
- CMake (see https://cmake.org)
- A BLAS library

Further optional recommended dependencies:
- FFTW (http://www.fftw.org)

For the GPU libraries :
- Fortran compiler with OpenACC support
- CUDA toolkit (compiler, and CUBLAS and CUFFT libraries)

Building ecTrans
----------------

Building and installing Trans happens via CMake, which provides automatic detection for
third-party libraries in standard locations and helps cross-plaform portability.
There are multiple ways to help CMake discover packages in non-standard locations.
One explicit way is to e.g. set environment variables for each dependency.

Environment variables 

    $ export ecbuild_ROOT=<path-to-ecbuild>
    $ export fiat_ROOT=<path-to-fiat>
    $ export CC=<path-to-C-compiler>
    $ export FC=<path-to-Fortran-compiler>

You must compile FIAT out-of-source, so create a build-directory (anywhere)

    $ mkdir build && cd build
 
Configuration of the build happens through standard CMake

    $ cmake

Extra options can be added to the `cmake` command to control the build:

 - `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug|RelWithDebInfo|Release|Bit>` default=RelWithDebInfo (typically `-O2 -g`)
 - `-DENABLE_TESTS=<ON|OFF>`            default=ON
 - `-DENABLE_SINGLE_PRECISION=<ON|OFF>` default=ON
 - `-DENABLE_DOUBLE_PRECISION=<ON|OFF>` default=ON
 - `-DENABLE_TRANSI=<ON|OFF>`           default=ON
 - `-DENABLE_MKL=<ON|OFF>`              default=ON
 - `-DENABLE_FFTW=<ON|OFF>`             default=ON
 - `-DENABLE_GPU=<ON|OFF>`              default=OFF
 - `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-prefix>`

More options to control compilation flags, only when defaults are not sufficient

 - `-DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS=<fortran-flags>`
 - `-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=<c-flags>`

Additional option for the GPU code, allowing to reduce memory consumption on the GPU at the 
cost of slower execution:

 - `-DENABLE_REDUCED_MEMORY=ON`

Once this has finished successfully, run ``make`` and ``make install``.

Optionally, tests can be run to check succesful compilation, when the feature TESTS is enabled (`-DENABLE_TESTS=ON`, default ON)

    $ ctest

The benchmark drivers are found in the bin directory.
A brief description of available command-line arguments can be obtained with e.g.
ectrans-benchmark-cpu-sp --help
