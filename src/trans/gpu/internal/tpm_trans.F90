! This is used in fourier space and in spectral space. It's reused among
! the transforms because we cannot reallocate - the captured CUDA graphs
! should not be modified. Hence, we keep it if it is large enough, otherwise
! we adapt the size. After 2 iterations this should lead to constant runtimes
! (the first iteration is used to get the max buffer size, the second iteration
! is going to recreate the graphs if needed)
